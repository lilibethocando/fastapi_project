# Welcome to the FastAPI Social App Project!

## Overview
Welcome to the exciting world of our FastAPI-based social app, a hub of Python-powered API development. This repository houses a compact yet robust social media application. Designed with innovation in mind, the app's core functionality revolves around creating, refining, and removing posts, user management, authentication, and empowering users to cast their votes on engaging posts.

## Key Features
Here's what makes our project shine:
- **FastAPI Magic:** The beating heart of this project is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a cutting-edge web framework for crafting impeccable RESTful APIs in Python. With FastAPI's speed and precision, we've built a foundation that ensures optimal performance and development efficiency.

- **Data Delight:** A meticulously designed database lies at the core of our app, where all the magic happens. Our data storage solution guarantees seamless information management and retrieval.

- **Library Love:** Our codebase is a showcase of Python's vibrant ecosystem. We've harnessed the power of various libraries, all neatly listed in the `requirements.txt` file, to amplify the capabilities of our social app.

- **Container Charm:** Docker takes center stage as we encapsulate our app within containers, streamlining deployment and ensuring consistency across various environments.

- **Worldwide Reach:** Our app isn't just confined to these virtual walls. We've taken it global, with deployments on both Ubuntu and Heroku. This means your creation isn't limited by borders; it's accessible to a worldwide audience.

- **CI/CD Synergy:** Say goodbye to manual deployment headaches. We've seamlessly integrated GitHub Actions into our workflow, automating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes. Your code journey from local development to production is now a breeze.

- **Database Evolution:** We've leveraged Alembic, a powerful database migration tool, to manage the evolution of our database schema. This ensures that your data structures remain agile and adaptable as the app grows.

## How to Use It
Ready to explore? [Click here](https://fastapi-lilibeth.herokuapp.com/) to access our home page. Once there, you can unleash the possibilities of our FastAPI Social App by clicking on 'Explore the API documentation & start executing them here.'

Here's how you can get started:

1. Create a user: Use the **Users** endpoint with the HTTP method **POST** to create a user.
2. Create an access token: For authentication, employ the **Authentication** endpoint with the HTTP method **POST** to log in and obtain an access token.
3. Authorization: Once on the app page, navigate to "Authorize" in the upper right corner. Fill out the requested fields to avoid having to repeatedly input your authentication information.
4. Begin Exploring: After obtaining your access token, you're all set! Start by adding users, creating posts, updating them, deleting them, and retrieving posts, among many other exciting possibilities.

Thank you for being a part of this project. Your ideas and contributions fuel our progress, as we strive to redefine social interaction through the realm of FastAPI.

Let's build connections, one API call at a time!
